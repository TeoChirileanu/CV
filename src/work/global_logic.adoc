! *Led the development of an abstracted, testable system*: Coordinated a team to create a comprehensive virtualized environment simulating the entire car wash operation, enabling thorough testing and validation of software components.

! *Implemented clean code and test-driven development (TDD) practices*: Ensured high-quality codebase, emphasizing maintainability, readability, and testability. This approach facilitated decoupling hardware implementations from software abstractions, resulting in a flexible and resilient system.

! *Introduced architectural patterns for enhanced maintainability*: Employed dependency inversion and interface segregation principles to design a system reliant on abstract interfaces, allowing for easy substitution of hardware components without disrupting the overall system functionality.

! *Provided regular updates and presentations to the US client*: Maintained open communication with stakeholders, demonstrating project progress, achieved milestones, and addressing any concerns, ultimately fostering trust and collaboration.
