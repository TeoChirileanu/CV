! *Business*: ING Bank Romania is a leading financial institution and a subsidiary of ING Group, a global banking and financial services corporation. Established in 1994, ING Bank Romania offers a wide range of products and services to individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, and large corporations. 

! *Technical*: Within the _BPM Core team_ at ING Bank Romania, I played a crucial role in developing and maintaining the _essential runtime platform_ that powered all internal enterprise applications. This platform, built on an n-tier architecture and utilizing plug-n-play modules, supported a diverse range of _mission-critical business applications_, including business lending, leads management, business banking, and card issuing. The platform seamlessly integrated with various _frontend applications_, such as FABO, NARC, and Homebank, through a robust and well-defined API. My responsibilities encompassed collaborating with _cross-functional teams_ to ensure the platform's stability, performance, and scalability, while actively supporting these business-critical processes. This involved a _deep understanding_ of the underlying technologies, problem-solving complex technical challenges, and optimizing the platform for _optimal performance and resilience_.
