! *Business*: SSE plc is a leading UK-based energy company focused on developing, owning, and operating low-carbon infrastructure to support the transition to net zero emissions. This includes onshore and offshore wind farms, hydro power, flexible thermal generation, and electricity networks. SSE also provides energy products and services to businesses and consumers.

! *Technical*: SSE leverages Azure's scalable cloud infrastructure to centralize and process half-hourly electricity and gas consumption data. SFTPs facilitate the collection of raw meter reads from large customer sites. The system then performs a series of technical operations like tariff/pricing calculation.  This refined data feeds into SSE's billing system, ensuring accurate invoicing. The AMI system also enables real-time monitoring and analysis of consumption patterns, empowering SSE to optimize energy management.

! *Ensured 24/7 Availability*: Provided continuous technical support for the meter readings system, proactively monitoring Azure Functions, resolving C# code issues, and delivering daily status reports to ensure uninterrupted data collection and processing.

! *Revamped TimeSamples System*: Spearheaded the modernization of the TimeSamples system, responsible for ingesting raw meter data, generating billable data, providing estimates for missing reads, and synchronizing with the pricing engine for accurate tariff calculations. This led to improved data quality, increased efficiency, and reduced revenue leakage.

! *Developed D365 F&O Data Entity Management Tool*: Built a custom .NET application to manage Data Entities within Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, enabling efficient comparison and synchronization across environments, adhering to best architectural practices.

! *Azure DevOps Pipeline Enhancement*: Contributed to the maintenance and implementation of Azure DevOps pipelines, ensuring smooth CI/CD processes for TimeSamples and the pricing machine, automating data entity comparisons in the cloud, and facilitating faster deployment cycles.
